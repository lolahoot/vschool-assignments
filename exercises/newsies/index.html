        Much needed tips to incorporate a day celebrating beer and Grandma Moses are below for you! 
        Invite only serious people - this is an important day, imagine the frolicking that may occur if you invited lighthearted silly people. Anyone from New Hampshire is a must have, however they should be required to bring either pumpkin or white potato as these are there state fruit and vegetable. Don't know where they'll get a pumpkin in September but they believe in "Live Free or Die" getting a pumpkin has got to be easier then that. The activity should be anything water. Slip and slides to water skiing. Since it won't rain or snow, make your own parcipitation. The final must have is to invite people to bring acorn squash, salami and beer. It may insue in a fight between the pumpkin and acorn fans, but whats a killer party without a little drama? Not killer.
